## Introduction

Welcome to the Virtual Forest: A Natural Paradise at Your Fingertips

Immerse yourself in the majesty of nature with our innovative Virtual Forest project. Designed to offer you an immersive and educational experience, this digital environment will allow you to explore the beauty and diversity of a forest from the comfort of your own home.

Our Virtual Forest is not only a space for exploration and fun, but also a powerful tool for fostering environmental awareness. Through interaction with this digital environment, we hope to inspire people to value and protect real forests, promoting sustainable practices and respect for nature.

## Prototype
we start with our prototype of our virtual forest, this is made in Blender, at first glance we can see that the forest contains several trees, mountains and some shrubs, and when running the program you will be able to enjoy this forest in first person, explore its landscapes within it and learn more about nature.

## Inspiration about the project
We were encouraged to create a forest since today not many people dare to go, so we wanted to create this forest so that those people who do not have the opportunity to go to one can be calm at home to enjoy it.

In the future, we plan to add more functionalities, such as the ability to interact with virtual animals and explore different ecosystems, to further enrich the experience.

We hope that this project will inspire users to appreciate and protect natural environments, by giving them an emotional connection to the virtual world.
