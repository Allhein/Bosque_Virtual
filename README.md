## Introduction

Welcome to the Virtual Forest: A Natural Paradise at Your Fingertips

Immerse yourself in the majesty of nature with our innovative Virtual Forest project. Designed to offer you an immersive and educational experience, this digital environment will allow you to explore the beauty and diversity of a forest from the comfort of your own home.

Our Virtual Forest is not only a space for exploration and fun, but also a powerful tool for fostering environmental awareness. Through interaction with this digital environment, we hope to inspire people to value and protect real forests, promoting sustainable practices and respect for nature.

## Prototype
we start with our prototype of our virtual forest, this is made in Blender, at first glance we can see that the forest contains several trees, mountains and some shrubs, and when running the program you will be able to enjoy this forest in first person, explore its landscapes within it and learn more about nature.

## Virtual Forest Video

In the following link you can see our forest with leafy trees, under a cloudy sky that adds a realistic and atmospheric touch. The tree models have been created and textured in Blender, providing an impressive level of detail. This project seeks to recreate the serenity and beauty of a forest, allowing users to explore and enjoy a realistic virtual landscape.

## Getting Started

## Running the app

You can run the main.cpp file in the Visual_Forest-main folder (do not move it out or rename it). The reason is that the required assets and libraries are located in the same folder.

1. Download the project
2. Create an empty project in Visual Community (C++) This must be created with the solution in the same path
3. Configure the libraries. In case of an error with a .dll, add it directly where the project's .exe is located
4. Debug the project

## How to Use the App

In the menu that will appear to the user we offer 2 options, in the first the user will choose the screen resolution, in the second if desired in a free mode (without collisions) and a normal mode (with collisions)

After the user selects a mode, the city will be displayed and run according to the selected mode. Once inside the program, the user can explore the forest at will.

## Inspiration about the project
We were encouraged to create a forest since today not many people dare to go, so we wanted to create this forest so that those people who do not have the opportunity to go to one can be calm at home to enjoy it.

We hope that this project will inspire users to appreciate and protect natural environments, by giving them an emotional connection to the virtual world.
