## Introduction

Welcome to the Virtual Forest: A Natural Paradise at Your Fingertips

Immerse yourself in the majesty of nature with our innovative Virtual Forest project. Designed to offer you an immersive and educational experience, this digital environment allows you to explore the beauty and diversity of a forest from the comfort of your own home.

Our Virtual Forest is not only a space for exploration and fun but also a powerful tool for fostering environmental awareness. Through interaction with this digital environment, we hope to inspire people to value and protect real forests, promoting sustainable practices and respect for nature.

## Prototype
We started with our prototype of the Virtual Forest, created in Blender. At first glance, you can see that the forest contains several trees, mountains, and some shrubs. When running the program, you will be able to enjoy this forest in first person, exploring its landscapes and learning more about nature.

## Virtual Forest Video

In the following link, you can see our forest with leafy trees under a cloudy sky that adds a realistic and atmospheric touch. The tree models have been created and textured in Blender, providing an impressive level of detail. This project seeks to recreate the serenity and beauty of a forest, allowing users to explore and enjoy a realistic virtual landscape.

## Getting Started

## Running the app

You can run the main.cpp file in the Visual_Forest-main folder (do not move or rename it). This is because the required assets and libraries are located in the same folder.

1. Download the project.
2. Create an empty project in Visual Community (C++). Ensure the solution is created in the same path.
3. Configure the libraries. If there is an error with a .dll file, add it directly to the folder where the project's .exe is located.
4. Debug the project.

## How to Use the App

In the menu that appears to the user, we offer two options. First, the user can choose the screen resolution. Second, the user can select between free mode (without collisions) and normal mode (with collisions).

After the user selects a mode, the city will be displayed and run according to the selected mode. Once inside the program, the user can explore the forest freely.

## Inspiration about the project
We were encouraged to create a forest because not many people today have the chance to visit one. We wanted to provide an opportunity for those who cannot go to a forest to enjoy it from the comfort of their homes.

We hope that this project will inspire users to appreciate and protect natural environments by giving them an emotional connection to the virtual world.
